# Scheduling-Queue-Simulator

Write a program to simulate one of two Process Scheduling algorithms a. Simulate either Shortest Job First (SJF) or Priority Scheduling.

# Requirements

1. Write a program to simulate one of two Process Scheduling algorithms
a. Simulate either Shortest Job First (SJF) or Priority Scheduling.

2. Program can be written as a Windows App or a Console App.
a. Can use either Java, C++, or Python programming languages.
b. A windows app has features to allow you to simulate the Ready Queue.
c. If console mode, use the Extended Ascii code set to print primitive boxes and 
borders, OR print out text lines describing what has happened.
d. Program shall display a queue in either graphical or console mode.

3. The user can enter three inputs to make the program work.
a. User enters (E) to execute the next Process in the Ready Queue.
b. User enters (A) to Add a process in the Ready Queue.
c. User enters (X) to Exit the program.

4. Show the queue being updated after a process finished running.

5. The program shall have the ability to place a new, ready process on the queue.
a. If using the priority scheme, a priority shall be associated with the process.
b. If using the SJF scheme, a CPU Burst time shall be associated with the process.
