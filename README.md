# Scheduling-Queue-Simulator

Write a program to Simulate how an Operating System schedules processes.

# Requirements

1. Write a program to simulate one of two Process Scheduling algorithms
    - Simulate either Shortest Job First (SJF) or Priority Scheduling.

2. Program can be written as a Windows App or a Console App.
    - Can use either Java, C++, or Python programming languages.
    - A windows app has features to allow you to simulate the Ready Queue.
    - If console mode, use the Extended Ascii code set to print primitive boxes and borders, OR print out text lines describing what has happened.
    - Program shall display a queue in either graphical or console mode.

3. The user can enter three inputs to make the program work.
    - User enters (E) to execute the next Process in the Ready Queue.
    - User enters (A) to Add a process in the Ready Queue.
    - User enters (X) to Exit the program.

4. Show the queue being updated after a process finished running.

5. The program shall have the ability to place a new, ready process on the queue.
    - If using the priority scheme, a priority shall be associated with the process.
    - If using the SJF scheme, a CPU Burst time shall be associated with the process.
